Generate your own front for your selfmade word clock.

## How to run (as of Dec' 2024):
1. cd into cloned directory
2. Update source path in `docker-compose.yaml`
3. run `docker compose up`
4. open in browser http://localhost:8100
5. DO NOT EXPOSE THIS TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN LOCALHOST! It uses 5-year old libraries!  

## Featues

- **Variants** - Many pre-configured fronts for the appropriate DIY kits
- **Export** - Export your generated front in the formats of SVG, DXF, PDF and PNG. Furthermore the additional options of a mirror inverted and / or outline version are also possible.
- **Matrix**
    - **Placement** - Free placement and size of the grid while maintaining the consistent positioning of each letter.
    - **Languages** - Many predefined language packs to choose from, which can easily be changed to your own wishes / slang.
    - **Fonts** - Simple, Modern, Shrill, Gothic, Classic or Klingon there is something for everyone. If not you can simply add your own font. (*Hint*: Only "Stencil" - fonts are also useful for a DXF export).
- **Branding** -  Give the front a personal signature or name.
- **Minutes** - Free placement and size of the minutes while keeping the symmetrical distances.
- **Alarm** - Selection of different alarm symbols for free placement, if the front ist for a word clock with an alarm clock function.
- **Color** - Just type in the [HEX](https://www.color-hex.com/) color values and get a preview of how it might look like later.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure latest Node 6 LTS and NPM 3+ are installed and install the Ionic CLI globally.
```Shell
$ npm install -g ionic@latest
```
 For more information and assistance, see: [Ionic Framework - Getting Started](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/)

### Installing

Clone or download the latest version of the project:
```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/SimonGolms/QLOCKGENERATOR
$ cd QLOCKGENERATOR
```
Install all the local dependencies:
```Shell
$ npm install
```
Start a local dev server for app dev/testing:
```Shell
$ ionic serve
```

## Add your own font

1. Add your font e.g. `MyOwnFont.ttf` in TrueType format to the folder `src/app/assets/fonts/`.
2. To ensure that the font can be used later during the generation, a new entry with the following structure must be added to the file `src/app/services/fonts.service.ts` in the variable `_fonts`:
    ```javascript
    {
        id: "30000",
        label: "MyOwnFont",
        category: FontCategory.REGULAR,
        filename: "MyOwnFont.ttf",
        path: this.DIRECTORY,
    }
    ```
3. To see the font already as a preview in the font selection, a new font-family entry has to be added to the `fonts.css` file under `src/app/assets/fonts/`.

## Built With
